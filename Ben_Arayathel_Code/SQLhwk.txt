2.7 DELETE
Delete a record from Customer Table where the name is Robert Walter.
	There are 2 ways from what I can see, either remove constraints (leaving orphaned records) or remove records until you reach the bottom child table.
	I opted for the latter (unfortunately):
		--Nested loop to remove rows from the bottom child table, "Invoiceline", Then removing invoice record, then customer record.
		DELETE FROM invoiceline WHERE invoiceid IN 
 		(SELECT invoiceid FROM invoice WHERE customerid = 
 		(SELECT customerid FROM customer WHERE firstname ='Robert' AND lastname = 'Walter'));
		--Deleting invoice records
		DELETE FROM invoice WHERE customerID = 
		(SELECT customerid FROM customer WHERE firstname = 'Robert' AND lastname = 'Walter');
		--Deleting customer ID finally
		DELETE FROM customer WHERE firstname = 'Robert' AND lastname = 'Walter';
