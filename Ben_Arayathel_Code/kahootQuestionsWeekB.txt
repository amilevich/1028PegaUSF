boxing: turning a datatype into an object
shadowing: using 2 variable with the same name within scopes that overlap.

Only Nested not public or protected class can be declared static. 

Time Complexity: Nested loops f(O(A),O(B)) = O(A*B)
		 serial loops f(O(A),O(B)) = O(A+B)

Wrapper Class: Changes primitive data types into an Object.

Deadlock:When 2 threads are waiting for each other and can never execute, i.e accessing the same memory buffer. (A wants B and B wants A)

Data Structure is a collection of darta values, the realtionshop among them and the operators within them.

finalize keyword: used to perform clean up processing just before garbage collection.

Collection: is an interface
Collections: class

Linear search: traverses a data structure sequentially and ehecks every element to find a specific element.

void keyword: The method does not return anything

WaitTime: A mehtod for thread, not a state type

Starvation: a thread holds a resource for a long time so the other thread are blocked forever
(Producer Consumer Poblem, )

Qeue - FIFO

Arguments: The proper term for the actual vvalue that is passed into a method

Daemon Thread: a thread that never topls running in the background.

Stack- LIFO

Heap - is where objects are stored in memory.	

.equals : echecks the memory location of two objects 
== : checks the actual value.

system.gc() : calls upon the garbage collector (not necessary).

Array: a collection of the same type and a fixed size.

start() method spawns a new thread while run() does not 

Stack .peek: look at first element 
	.pop: removes the first element
	.push adds an element to stack (becomes the first element)

Algorithm is not language specific
