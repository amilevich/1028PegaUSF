Section 7 - Managing Application Development

Branch - Is a container for rulesets that are being developed (usually in an enviornment where the application is being developed by multiple teams)

Branch ruleset - is a ruleset that is based of another ruleset. Contains rules that are in active development in the assoicated branch.

Benefits of branching:
	Allows parallel development (2 or more development reams can configure an application). 
	Rule development takes place within an isolated space without affecting functionality in the source rules.

Configuring a branching rulest:
	1)Create a team application
	2) Create development branch(es) in the team application
	3)Grant access to the team application 
	4) Create or configure rules using the branch 
	5) Merge each branch into the application rulesets when development is complete and stable.
