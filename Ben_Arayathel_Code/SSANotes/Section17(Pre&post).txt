Section 17- Introduction to flow action pre- and post-prcoessing

Should be able to:

Explain how pre- and post-processing configurations affect flow actions 
Configure pre- and post-prcoessing actions for a flow action

Pre-processing configuration:
	Occurs at the start of a flow shape (at the arrow), when you want to complete the data transform or the activity before the flow action is pre
	sented to the user. 
	e.g. populate a form with default values, but once the user changes it, does not repopulate the form on a refresh 

Post-processing configuration:
	Occurs straight after a flow shape(at the beginning of the connector).
	Performs the action after the flow action 
	e.g. populating the shipping address with the personal address the user submitted.


Stuff to consider:
	Pega loads the flow action with the highest likelihood by default, so a pre-processing action on the flow action 
	automatically executes when the user reaches an assignment.
	
	If a pre- or post-processing action applies to only one case type, then specialise the flow action for the case type,
	instead of adding the pre- or post processing action.
