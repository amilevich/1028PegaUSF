Section 15 - Configuring parallel processing 

Parallel processing allows user to complete tasks independently of each other.

Pega offers 3 different ways:
	
Split Join 
	Allows you to call multiple indpenendent processes that operate in parallel. 
	Main process continues after all the subprocesses are completed.
	e.g. Completing a background check while also reconfiguring seating plan at an office
	
Split for each 
	Same as split join
	Except, Main process will carry on after each parallel task is completed
	e.g. completing the interviews for all candidates 

Spinoff 
	A subprocess that can be completed in conjuction with the main process.
	Does not have any dependecy on the main process, main process can be completed before the spinoff process


Case Locking 
	By default Pega prohibits more than one user to have access to one case instance. 
	You can configure the cae to allow multiple users, enabling both to open the case. If both submit changes the first users changes is what is saved. 

Locking in the case type hierachy 
	Once you've conigrued a locking strategy in the top level case,  the strategy cascades down to the child cases. 
	Recomended to only allow one user locking option, to preserve the integrity of child cases. 
	
If you want users to work on the top level classes while the child cases are open, you overdied the default setting that lock the parent case.
