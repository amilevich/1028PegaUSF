Section 13 - Duplicate and Temporary cases

Duplicate case - an open instance of your case type that match a set of conditions in another case instance. 

Temporary case - A case that does not have a case ID and is only saved onto the clipboard, not a database.
		(purpose is to save storage and system perfomance, e.g. when a user might be just viewing info rather than editing it).
		You can persist a temporary cases by adding a Persist Case SmartShape to the process.


Checking for duplicate cases:
	Basic conditions - All basic conditions have to be met for Pega to check the weighted conditions.
	Weighter conditions - By weighing each conditions and specifing a threshold we can specify how strictly we check for duplicate cases.
