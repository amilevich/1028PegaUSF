Section 2 - Application Development: Creating a Pega Application

Application - a business solution that automates work flow in your organisation.
		multiple applications can be run on your Pega system and an App
		can be created through the New Application Wizard.

Enterprise Class Structure (ECS) - It's a storage structure of your application 
		elements, with the position defining the reusability of the element.
		ECS allows us organisations to make applications that are reusable and 
		adaptable to business needs.
		Application -- Division -- Entreprise 
		(Rules can be shared between application layers)

ECS Layers:

	(Reuse Layer)
	Organization - contains assets that are used across the enterprise. An example 
			being assets such as rules that dictate the business logic 
			across the enterprise, e.g. Desicion tables, SLA and standard properties.
	Division - the next level below organization (Org-Div-Unit) , contains assets division
			wide, available to be used in any application. Assets may apply to a line
			of business, region or brand.
			(It's an optional layer, useful for large companies for managing assets)

	(Application layer)
	Pega Platform - built in assets necessary for processing cases and other needs. 
			Also contains assets that the Pega Platform uses.
	Framework - contains the most 'general' application, generally its assets are extended 
			in the implementation level for specific business needs. 
			(e.g. Request Approval -> Approving holidays)
	Implementation - defines an application customised for a specific business need or division.
			typically extends one or more framework layer.

	Generally the Class name starts of with Organisation-Application-Class Group

New Application Wizard - streamlines the creation of the application by creating the enterprise class structure for you.
