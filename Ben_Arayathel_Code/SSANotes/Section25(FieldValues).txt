Section 25 - Field Values

Property - defines the format and visual presentation of data in your application. Each property can be associated with a value and has a mode and tupe. The property 
	mode, such as Single Value or Page List, difines the structure that is used to store the property value. The property type, such as Text or Date, defines the 
	format and allowable charachters in the property value. 

Field values provide an alternate method for defining allowed values for properties. Field values enable you to manage the list of allowed values separately from the property.
	Managing the allows values seperately from the property enables you to reuse a single property.

Example, we have the property name .pyStatusWork (case status). The list of allowed values for setting .pyStatusWork is defined used field values.

Can localise field values.
