Pega organisational structure is a 3-level hierachy.
	Top level is - Organisation (Represents the whole company)
	Middle level - Divisions (Categorised as business units such as region, brank or department)

An operator is associated with a unit, divison and organisation. The operator ID record (also an organisation rule) stores the organisational structure of the operator

A work queue is an orangisational rule but is not part of the organisational hierarchy. A work queue belongs to a unit, a division and an organisation.
By default an operator can access work in the work queue to which the operator belongs.
