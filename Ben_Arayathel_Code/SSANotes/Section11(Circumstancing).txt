Section 9 - Circumstancing rules

Circumstancing rules - allows rule to be executed when a condtion is met. If no cicumstanced rule meet the conditions then the base rule is executed.

Circumstance - an optional qualification avaialbe for supported rule types. based on an unqualified rule known as a base rule.

Circumstancing - praciste of creating additional variabts of a rule based on specific circumstances, such as property value
		Allows you to describe exception habvior with a set of targeted rules rather than one complex rule.
		Each targeted rule configures behavior to address a specific exception. 

Types of circumstancing conditions:
	single value - single property needs to be satisfied 
	Multiple value - multiple properties need to be satisfied.
	Date property - is effective whenever the value of a date property satisfies the circumstancing condition. 
	As-of date - after a certain date, the circumstanced rule effectively becomes the new base rule


Configuring circumstancing
	Circumstance template - Dictaes whate properties will be checked e.g. .country
	Circumstance definition- will define what a property has to satisfy e.g. .country = "India"
	Circumstance record - store the circumstance in the database, I think?

If you place a base rule in a higher ruleset version you will bypass any older rule versions that are circumstanced.
If you place a withdrawn status in a circumstanced rule, all previous versions of the rule with the same circumstanced rule will also be unavailable.
	(Not rules that are base or have different circumstance).
