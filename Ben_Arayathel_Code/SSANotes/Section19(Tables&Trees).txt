Section 19 - Configuring Desicion tables and trees

Desicioning is essential to enforcing business decisions. Pega offers decision tables and trees to do this.

A decision rule can also automatically select a connctor to advance a case or route to worklists/work queue.
Tables and trees allow you to make it more complex, rather than a simple yes/no decisioning.

Descision tables:
	Format is simlar to an excel table, simpler to understand.
	Allows you to evaluate multiple conditions in unison (this is when you choose it over a when rule)
	Delegated tables allow users to quickly adjust the table to meet business needs.

Decision trees:
	An alternative to a table to evalue a set of test conditions. 
	tables evalueate against the same set of properties or doncitions, tress evaluate afainst different properties or conditions. 
	For tress, a true comparison can lead to additional comparisons (if...then...else logic).
	Contain condition branches -comparison value, comparison operator and an action. 
	Branches can be nested.

Testing with decisioning:
	Test for Logic 
		Creating a test page to make sure the logic of the decision structure is valid.
	Test for Conflicts 
		Test for condtions that contradict each other (e.g. a contradictory branching condition within a branch)
	Test for completeness
		For tables, there is an option to show all the values that are not being considered explicitly in the table.
