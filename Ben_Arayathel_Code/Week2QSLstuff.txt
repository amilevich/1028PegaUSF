What a database? 
	An organised collection of data 

What is DBMS?
	Database Management System. Tables not related.

What is RDBMS?
	Relational Database Management System. Tables related 

What is SQL?
	Structured Query Language (Procedural language), domain-specific language used to manage data in a database

What is DML?
	Data Manipulation Language, (subsection of SQL) it is used to manage data entries (records) it contains the keywords INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT.

What is DDL?
	Data Definition Language, (subsection of SQL) it is used to create or alter tables, contains CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

What is DQL?
	Data Query Language, (S/SQL) it is used to read data in databases, contains SELECT.

What is TCL?
	Transaction Control Language, it keeps instances of the tables and logs transactions (any changes on the table). Keywords: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

What is a query?
	A query is a single statement as part of the DML, (typically keywords) SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT. 

What are the properties of transactions?
	Transactions are a group/set of statements. They can contains anything within SQL, e.g. CREATE, COMMIT, INSERT
	Transactions are ACID - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable
		Atomic - All or Nothing, A transaction will fail if any of the queries within the group fail.
		Consistent - Data integrity is always maintained (i.e. a global copy of the database exists if a local one fails)
		Isolation - Transactions do not intefere with each other.
		Durable - Changes that are commited by a transaction persist, even in event of system failure.

What is a key?
	A key is used to find a records/data-rows. It can be a single or multiple fields or attributes. Keys are used to establish relations with different tables
		or views.

What is a candidate key?
	A key that can uniquely identify a record (can be 1 or more attributes), a table can have multiple candidate keys.

What is a primary key?
	Is used to uniquely identify a record. It can be a single or multiple attribute/field (but it's not NULL and can't accept DUPLICATE values), a single table
		can only have 1 primary key (i.e. only 1 candidate key in a table can be a primary key).

What is a composite key?
	A composite key consists of multiple attributes/fields to uniqely find a record.

What is a foreign key?
	A field in a database that is the Primary key for another table. (e.g. in a employee table, department could be a primary key for for department table).

What is mulitplicity?
	A mapping of records to records, e.g. 1-1 (name - SSN) , 1-many (Customer - products), many-1 (Employees - Bosses), many-many (Names - Birthdays).

What is referential integrity?
	Referential integrity is with regards to foreign keys in a table. Every foriegn key must reference a vaild record (we can't have orphaned records).
		This can occur if we delete a row in a table without removing the foreign key referencing it as well. 

What is cascade delete?
	Cascade delete is what allows us to maintain referential integrity. If we delete a record in a table, we remove all foreign keys with references to it.
