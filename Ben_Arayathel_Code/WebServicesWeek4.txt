Web Services

-software that makes itself available over the web 
-simply put, a dependency 

SOA - Service Oriented Architecture 
-technique for building applications using loosely coupled services.

REST - Representational State Transfer 
-web service that follows SOA, allows for any data format and writes HTTP as its protocol 
-HTTP Request message 

	HTTP	||	Request	||	message || Can only contain either a Head or a Body 
	Web 	|| 	URL 	|| 	Version ||
-HTTP Response message 

	||State Code|| Version || - Can also only contain Head or body 
		
Types of verbs:
	GET 
	POST
	PUT
	DELETE
	PATCH
	OPTIONS
	TRACE
	CONNECT

ITEM POTENCY - verbs that can be reused repeatedly (i.e. delete is not potent, it's all about the outcome)

RESTFUL API is a API that follows REST constraints 
1) Uniform Interface - each entity's API should follow the same patter, no operations should have no more than 1 URL 
2) Stateless - servers do not store any data about the latest HTTP requests
3) Layerd System - client cannot tell whether it is connected to the original server or another one
4) Client-Server - client/server are seperate entities 
5)Cacheable - resource must declare themselves as cacheable
6)OPTIONAL - Code on Demand. Able to send executable code to the original server or another srever.


SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol 
XML only 
any protocol
if using HTTP only POST 
WSDL -Web Service Description Language - descrive web services, how to use SOAP
	<WSDL>
	<types>
	<message>
	<portType>
	<binding>
	<service>
	<operation>
	</WSDL>

To create a SOAP service:
	1)Contract First ( WSDL ->implementation code)
	2) Contract Last (code -> WSDL)

To generate a WSDL
	1) JAX - WS (Marshalling tool, converts object to string (i.e. JSON or XML, in this case XML file format)
	2) Apache CFX (SOAP engine)
