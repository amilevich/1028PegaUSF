	 * access modifiers they restrict access to classes, methods, variables, etc
	 * 
	 * Encapsulation is typically achieved by making the variables private so they
	 * can only be acccessed within the same class
	 * 
	 * "private" - class itself default - class itslef and package "protected" -
	 * class itslef, package, children "public" - class itself, package, children,
	 * everything Note: most restricted to least
	 * 
	 * 
	 * However, it is possible to access the private fields if we provide getter and
	 * setter methods. Usually, they are public.
	 * 
	 * Get -> returns the variable name Set -> sets the value
	 * 
	 * "this" refers back to this particular object / class "super" refers to parent
	 * of class
